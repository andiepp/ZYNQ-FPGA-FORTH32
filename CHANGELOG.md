# Changelog

ZYNQ-FPGA-FORTH32 continues the version numbers of the 16-bit
[ZYNQ-FORTH](https://github.com/andiepp/ZYNQ-FORTH) (whose changelog has releases 1.0 to
2.3), as its 32-bit generation 3.x.

## Unreleased

- **Design document**: `docs/design.md`, also as `docs/Design.pdf` (`python
  tools/manual_pdf.py design`), now describes the whole design in detail: the HF32 CPU and its
  memory timing, the FPU's datapath, every peripheral, the ARM program, the Forth kernel
  layer by layer, tools, verification and the build. Release packages include the PDF.

## 3.1 — 2026-11-04

- **Serial interfaces in hardware**, every signal on any pin: two UARTs (8N1, any baud
  rate, 64-byte FIFOs), two SPI masters (modes 0..3, 8/16/32 bits, MSB/LSB first, up to
  12.5 MHz) and an I2C master (up to 400 kHz, open drain, clock stretching, on the shield's
  SCL/SDA by default). Words: `uart-open uart-close uart-emit uart-type uart-key uart-key?
  uart-status`, `spi-open spi-close spi-hz spi-mode spi-bits spi-lsb spi-xfer spi-write
  spi-read`, `i2c-open i2c-open-pins i2c-close i2c@ i2c! i2c-scan i2c-probe i2c-addr
  i2c-start i2c-stop i2c-write i2c-read`.
- **DDS**: a square wave on any pin from a 32-bit phase accumulator at 200 MHz (0.047 Hz
  steps, 5 ns edges): `dds-hz dds-pin dds-off`.
- **Tone generator** on the board's audio jack: sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, a
  click-free volume ramp, delta-sigma output into the board's filter: `tone tone-off wave
  volume beep`, constants `sine square triangle sawtooth`.
- **Pins 42..47**: the shield's SCL and SDA and the SPI header's MISO, MOSI, SCK, SS are now
  pins too (`pin-scl` … `pin-ss`), usable as GPIO. A **pin router** gives peripherals their
  pins; the kernel records the owner of each pin (`owner`) and refuses a pin that is taken
  (` pin taken`), PWM included.
- Firmware 3.1: the `board` answer's `fn` line and HASE function 0x49 report the pin
  functions; the app's board view shows the six new pins and labels pins a peripheral owns.
- I/O decoding widened to 256 registers; the new blocks live at `$100200..$1002AC`.

## 3.0 — 2026-11-03

Started from ZYNQ-FORTH 2.3.

- **HF32 CPU**: 32-bit cells and 32-bit instructions in the same J1-style classes, 128 KB of
  RAM (was 16 KB), 15-bit cell-address program counter, 32-entry data, return and float
  stacks, arithmetic right shift. One instruction per clock at 50 MHz.
- **Floating point** in hardware (`rtl/hf32_mcu.v`): IEEE single precision, round to
  nearest even, subnormals flushed to zero, one quiet NaN; add, subtract, multiply, divide,
  square root, int↔float conversion and truncation, plus compares and sign operations in the
  ALU. The 32 × 32 multiply moved into the same multi-cycle unit (3 clocks). A bit-exact
  Python model (`tools/hf32.py`) is checked against IEEE (`tools/test_fpu.py`) and the RTL
  against the model (`sim/run_mcu.ps1`).
- **Kernel**: all words of ZYNQ-FORTH 2.3 with the same names and stack effects, now on
  32-bit cells (durations and periods stay double cells, where a double `lo hi` means
  `lo + hi*65536`, so 16-bit sources keep working), plus `us@` (a microsecond counter),
  `arshift`, `s>d`, `dnegate`, `fill`; the floating-point words: float literals,
  `f@ f! fconstant fvariable fliteral`, stack words, arithmetic, compares, `floor fround
  ftrunc`, `s>f f>s d>f f>d`, `>float represent precision set-precision f. fs. fe. f.s`,
  `pi fsin fcos fsincos ftan fasin facos fatan fatan2 fexp fln flog falog f** fsinh fcosh
  ftanh flnp1 fexpm1`, and `volts@ ftemp@`. Number conversion in both directions is correctly
  rounded; the functions are within about 2 ulp.
- **I/O map**: register k at `$100000 + 4k` (was `$8000 + 2k`); the ms counter is 32 bits.
- **Firmware 3.0, protocol 2**: `stack` answers 32-bit cells and a second line with the float
  stack; `words` addresses have five hex digits; `version` adds `cell 32` and `float 32`.
  The saved source has its own flash sector (0xFE0000, magic `HF32`), so the 16-bit one at
  0xFF0000 survives.
- **HASE**: still the Forth-Lab MCNF node (type AE.07.30.80, reports 3.0) with the 16-bit
  node's functions, so the HASE Forth-Lab panel works unchanged (stack cells clipped to
  16 bits there); new functions 0x45 (data stack, 32 bits), 0x46 (float stack), 0x47 and
  0x48 (dictionary with 32-bit addresses).
- **App 3.0** (`ZynqForth32.exe`, product ZYNQ-FPGA-FORTH32): the stack panel shows 32-bit
  cells and a float stack list; settings in `%LocalAppData%\ZYNQ-FPGA-FORTH32`.
