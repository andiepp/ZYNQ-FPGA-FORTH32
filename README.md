# ZYNQ-FPGA-FORTH32

A 32-bit interactive Forth with hardware floating point, on its own CPU in the FPGA of a
Digilent **Arty Z7-20**, with a Windows app to program it.

It is the 32-bit generation of [ZYNQ-FORTH](https://github.com/andiepp/ZYNQ-FORTH) (16-bit,
HF16) and kept separate from it: the board I/O, the app and the word names are the same, so
16-bit sources run here, while cells, addresses and the CPU are new.

- **HF32**, a 32-bit dual-stack CPU in the Zynq's programmable logic whose instructions are
  Forth primitives: one instruction per clock at 50 MHz, 128 KB of RAM.
- A **floating-point unit** for IEEE single precision (round to nearest even), with its own
  **float stack**: `f+ f- f*` in 5–6 clocks, `f/ fsqrt` in 31, conversions in 2–4.
- A **Forth kernel** of 354 words, written in Forth and cross-compiled on the PC: the
  interpreter and compiler, the Forth-2012 floating-point words (literals like `1.5e-3`,
  `f. fs. fe.`, `fsin fcos ftan fatan2 fasin facos fexp fln flog f** fsqrt`…), correctly
  rounded number conversion, the board's LEDs, RGB LEDs, buttons and switches, 36 shield
  pins, 4 PWM channels, 9 analog inputs through the XADC (also in volts as floats), and the
  pattern generator.
- **Serial interfaces on any pin**: 2 UARTs, 2 SPI masters (up to 12.5 MHz) and an I2C
  master (on the shield's SCL/SDA by default), with words like `uart-open uart-emit
  spi-xfer i2c@ i2c! i2c-scan`.
- A **DDS** for a square wave of any frequency on any pin (200 MHz, 0.05 Hz steps) and a
  **tone generator** on the board's audio jack (sine, square, triangle, sawtooth,
  click-free volume): `1e6 dds-hz 13 dds-pin`, `440e tone`.
- A **pattern generator**: 16 digital channels on the Pmod headers JA and JB, played in
  steps of 5 ns from its own 200 MHz clock; 4096 steps with repeats, jumps, waits for a
  pin, button or software trigger ([docs/PatternGenerator.md](docs/PatternGenerator.md)).
- The **ARM core** loads the kernel and carries Forth's terminal over the USB serial port.
  Any terminal program (PuTTY, Tera Term) talks to Forth directly; the app adds service
  requests on the same line ([docs/Protocol.md](docs/Protocol.md)).
- **HASE compatible**: the same firmware is also the Forth node of the
  [HASE](https://github.com/andiepp/HASE) laboratory and switches to HASE's MCNF protocol by
  itself when a HASE host talks to it. It answers like the 16-bit Forth-Lab node, so today's
  HASE Forth-Lab panel works with it; new functions carry the 32-bit and float stacks.
- One Forth source can be **saved in flash** and runs at every start (hold BTN3 to skip it).
  It has its own flash sector, so the 16-bit ZYNQ-FORTH's saved source survives a switch.
- The **app**: editor, terminal, data stack and float stack, dictionary, saved source, a
  pattern editor (timing diagram), a live view of the board, and five skins: IDE dark, IDE
  light, Green phosphor, Amber and Lab panel.

### Pattern generator pinout

As the headers look on the board, 3.3 V and GND at the left:

```
          Pmod JA                               Pmod JB
 pin    6    5    4    3    2    1        6    5    4    3    2    1
      3V3  GND  CH3  CH2  CH1  CH0      3V3  GND  CH11 CH10 CH9  CH8
      3V3  GND  CH7  CH6  CH5  CH4      3V3  GND  CH15 CH14 CH13 CH12

```

3.3 V outputs, not short-circuit protected (the fast Pmods have no series resistors). A
1 MHz clock on channel 0:

```forth
pg-stop 1 pg-enable 0 pg-at  1 500 ns pg-step  0 500 ns 0 pg-jump  pg-start
```

## Building

Needs AMD/Xilinx **Vivado and Vitis 2023.2** (the Arty Z7-20 board files are included in
that version), **Python 3** and the **.NET 10 SDK**. The Xilinx launchers are not on PATH;
call them by their full path, below through `$xilinx`, the folder Vivado and Vitis are
installed in. The PowerShell scripts find Vivado and Vitis themselves (`XILINX_VIVADO`,
`XILINX_VITIS`, or `\Xilinx\…\2023.2` on any drive; else pass `-Vivado` / `-Vitis`). From the
repository root:

```powershell
$xilinx = 'C:\Xilinx'      # where Vivado and Vitis 2023.2 are installed

# bitstream and hardware description: build\hw\forth.bit, forth.xsa
& "$xilinx\Vivado\2023.2\bin\vivado.bat" -mode batch -nojournal -nolog -source hw/build_hw.tcl

# kernel image and ARM program: build\sw\forth_app\Debug\forth_app.elf
& "$xilinx\Vitis\2023.2\bin\xsct.bat" sw/build_sw.tcl

# boot image: build\boot\BOOT.bin
.\sw\build_boot.ps1

# the app and its tests
dotnet build app\ZynqForth.slnx
dotnet test app\ZynqForth.slnx
```

To put it on the board:

- **Flash** (permanent): JP4 to JTAG, power on, `.\sw\program_flash.ps1`, then JP4 to QSPI
  and power-cycle. This replaces the 16-bit ZYNQ-FORTH in flash; flash its BOOT.bin to go
  back (both saved sources are kept).
- **JTAG** (until power-off, for development): JP4 to JTAG, power on,
  `& "$xilinx\Vitis\2023.2\bin\xsct.bat" sw/run.tcl`.

A kernel change (`forth/kernel.fs`) needs only `sw/build_sw.tcl` and a new boot image, no new
bitstream. Test it first in the simulator:

```powershell
python tools/hf32.py run forth/kernel.fs -f sim/smoke.txt
python tools/test_float_words.py
.\sim\run_sim.ps1 -InputFile sim\float.txt     # the same session on the RTL
.\sim\run_mcu.ps1                              # the FPU against its bit-exact model
```

`.\tools\Install-App.ps1` installs the released app (from `dist\publish`, or downloaded from
the GitHub release) for the current user and puts a **ZYNQ-FORTH32** shortcut on the desktop.
A development build runs from `app\src\ZynqForth\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\ZynqForth32.exe`. It keeps
its settings in `%LocalAppData%\ZYNQ-FPGA-FORTH32`, apart from the 16-bit app's. Its skins
are generated from one colour table: edit `app/tools/make_skins.py` and run it.
